## Changelog v4.2.6-4.2.7
- Added an "Active/Expired accounts" table shown after the status check (you can remove non‑working accounts with one click).
- Added an extension that automates account re‑login. See the AutoLogin README: [WPlace AutoLogin — Chrome Extension](https://github.com/lllexxa/wplacer/blob/main/Wplacer-AutoLogin-Profiles/README.md)


## Changelog v4.2.5 QUICK FIX
- Fixed extension!
- Added automatic Cloudflare Turnstile solving!
- Works on Chrome-based browsers (not tested on others). Re-upload the extension to your browser!
Known issues: If you constantly see `❌ Background resync finished (error)` on an account while template is running, you should re‑login (refresh cookies). HTTP 401 can appear occasionally and usually does not break the flow, but I cannot fully fix it yet. Please remember this build is unstable.
Recommendation: keep a `wplace.live` tab focused (active) while running to avoid throttling and ensure stable token acquisition.


## Changelog v4.2.4
- Proxy: improved proxy handling; blocking proxies are now quarantined for 20 minutes.
- Proxy: added a settings option to validate proxies and remove non‑working ones (note: some proxies may work intermittently).
- Logging: added log category toggles in `settings.json` — you can disable noisy categories (e.g., `queuePreview`, `drawingMode`, `startTurn`, `mismatches`).


## Changelog v4.2.3
- Fixed extension behavior.
- You need to reload the extension in your browser (refresh it in chrome://extensions or reinstall it).


## Changelog v4.2.2
- Front-End improvements:
  - Added a counter to the palette header: “Remaining colors” now shows the total number of remaining pixels.
  - Added a “Refresh canvas” button in the preview. Clicking it reloads the visible area.
  - Added an overlay pixel scale slider (50–100%).
  - When “Stop” is pressed, the template now stops right after the current request to a single tile (fixed).
  - Heatmap: fixed and optimized (You can also now enable and configure this in the template settings).
  - Fixed preserving user checkboxes when opening a template and when changing the user sort order.
  - Added a progress counter to “Check Account Status”.
  
Note: The next update will focus on fixing drawing modes, improving template rendering with premium colors, and addressing other core issues. As this is a fork, occasional instability is expected.


## Changelog v4.2.1
- Fixed an issue with alternating "Painted // Token expired/invalid" during drawing.
- Added custom labeling for accounts (e.g., account email or browser profile) to facilitate easier navigation and management when refreshing cookies. Check "Edit User" section.

  - Added a warning box before 'Check Account Status' when Account Check Cooldown equals 0.
  - Added a warning box before 'Start Template' when Account Turn Cooldown equals 0.


## Changelog v4.2.0
- Trying to fix token issue
- Heatmap preview added


## Changelog v4.1.9
- Fixed cooldown handling so settings-based delays are respected between all parallel requests (cache warm-up, keep-alive, colors check, purchases) both with and without proxies, and added a proxy concurrency setting to control the number of parallel workers (except drawing).
- Active bar: added per-template Preview button and progress bar.
- Manage Users: total charges now shown as X/Y pixels.
- Regen Speed: fixed.
- Add/Edit Template: sorting by available charges added; shows X/max near drops.

  - \[ipv6]:port
  - host:port
  - user:pass:host:port
  - Inline comments in data/proxies.txt via `#` or `//` are ignored
- Fixed the issue with stretched images in previews.

## Changelog v4.1.7 HARD-CODE FIX OF THE DRAWING
- Re-upload the extension to your browser!

## Changelog v4.1.6
Reminder: If drawing stops, inspect console logs in wplace.live for Turnstile errors (or set the pixel manually). If it’s a Turnstile issue, restart your browser or log in via incognito/another browser or profile.
